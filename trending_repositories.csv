fdundjer /solana-sniper-bot,Solana Sniper Bot - Proof of Concept,TypeScript,363,198,165,"The Solana Sniper Bot Proof of Concept code demonstrates a way to buy new tokens immediately when a liquidity pool opens for trading. The script listens for new pools on Raydium for USDC or SOL and buys tokens using a fixed amount in USDC or SOL. The purchase usually occurs before the token is available on the Raydium UI for swapping. It's provided for educational purposes only.

To run the script, you need to set up a new Solana wallet, transfer SOL to it, convert some SOL to USDC or WSOL, and configure the script by updating the `.env.copy` file. You can also customize settings such as the snipe list, auto-sell feature, and common issues troubleshooting. Running the script will output information about the executed transactions.

If you want to focus on buying specific tokens during their launch, you can use the snipe list feature by specifying token mint addresses in the `snipe-list.txt` file. The script will then buy only those listed tokens.

Additionally, the script has an auto-sell feature, which can be enabled or disabled. If enabled, you can set parameters for automatic selling of tokens after a specified delay. However, there are no guarantees of profit, and the developer is not responsible for any losses.

There are common issues that may arise, such as empty transactions, unsupported RPC nodes, and missing token accounts in wallets. These issues can be addressed by adjusting settings or changing RPC nodes.

Finally, it's important to note that using this script comes with risks, and users should be cautious and use it at their own risk."
